# Dependencies
# ============
#
# Version policy
# --------------
# The policy in specifying dependencies versions are to use tilde requirements
# according to
# <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html?highlight=feature#tilde-requirements>
# with full semver version specification (major, minor and patch components)
# which means that we may upgrade for patches/bugfixes, but must not change
# even the minor version of the package.
# Once the library is stable consider upgrading tilde requirements to strict
# equivalence requirements (with '=' sign) since even dependencies patching will
# not introduce risk of breaking the consensus and even security updates must
# be done manually after through testing
